/*
 We integrate Font Awesome in a special way that gives us all the convenience we need, but doesn't slow down
 scss rendering during development when no caching can be used. This basically means that we use mostly the
 pre-compiled version of Font Awesome and only use scss where it is absolutely necessary.
